          When your doctor, insurer, or other health care provider holds your health information,
          they are required by HIPAA to keep that information private and
          secure. But what about the privacy and security of the information you hold
          yourself? Below, you can find out more about the types of health information you
          might have yourself, and how to keep it safe.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-title">What kinds of information do you have?</h3>
        <p>
          It is up to you to decide what you want to keep private and secure. But first, you
          have to know what information you have, and where it came from. Think about
          what you have in each of these categories:
        </p>
        <p><span class="fw-strong">Physical records</span> (e.g. paper copies, film, CDs, DVDs): Many people keep physical copies of some medical
          records in their home such as visit
          summaries, test results, ultrasound printouts, CDs with MRI scans, and
          others. Some of the information contained in these records may be highly
          personal or sensitive.
        </p>
        <p><span class="fw-strong">Electronic records copied or downloaded</span> to your personal computer, tablet, or
          other device: If you have access to your records via Blue Button or another
          patient portal, you might download copies of those records to your personal
          computer or device. Or, you might scan your paper records to keep them
          organized in an electronic filing system or to send to a physician. Or you
          might choose to transfer files given to you on CD or DVD to your computer.
          However your records moved to one of these devices, anyone with access to
          these devices — whether physically or through hacking — may be able to
          access your personal information.
        </p>
        <p><span class="fw-strong">Electronic records kept on the Internet</span>, or "in the cloud." When kept by a
          health care provider or insurer, online record systems are protected by
          HIPAA regulations. But if you copy records to another system, like a third-party
          Personal Health Record system, those records are not protected by
          HIPAA. But in either case, those systems cannot protect against unauthorized
          access by individuals who have access to your username, password, and
          other credentials.
        </p>
        <p><span class="fw-strong">"Records" you create yourself.</span>Keep in mind that you may create health
          "records" that fall into any of these categories, even though they aren't
          records from your doctor, insurer, or other health care provider. Examples
          include:
          <ul>
            <li>Diaries of symptoms, medications, activities, or other items</li>
            <li>Apps that track your daily activity, your blood pressure, your glucose readings, or other regular measurements</li>
            <li>A post you write on an online health forum</li>
            <li>An email you write to your doctor</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-title">Strategies for keeping your information safe</h3>
        <p>
          Most of the above examples call for a combination of approaches to help keep your
          information safe and secure. Below, you'll find some general tips that you can apply
          to as needed based on what you have, and what you want to keep safe. But note that
          no tip list can cover every possible situation, and we recommend that you seek out
          more information and help as needed.
        </p>
        <h4>Physical security</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Keep important paper records and other physical media like CDs and DVDs
            in a locked filing cabinet or fire safe, and keep the key separate from the
            storage unit.
          </li>
          <li>
            Don't keep unnecessary copies. For example, if you print out an extra copy of
            a record to use during a phone conversation, lock it away or destroy it after
            the fact.
          </li>
          <li>Avoid keeping written copies of passwords.</li>
          <li>
            If you have a Flash drive or hard drive with private records, detach it from
            your computer when not in use to prevent unauthorized access. Consider
            storing the drive in a fire safe.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>General computer and network security</h4>
        <p>
          Turn your computer off when not in use.
          Create a password for your WiFi network, or use software to segment your
          WiFi network to prevent guests from accessing other computers and devices on the same network.
          Do not join unfamiliar or untrusted WiFi networks.
          If you have a Flash drive or hard drive with private records, detach it from your computer when not in use to prevent unauthorized access. Consider storing the drive in a fire safe.
        </p>
        <h4>Password and authentication security</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Protect your computer with a password, and require use of the password to start up the computer or wake the computer from sleep.</li>
          <li>Protect your smartphone or tablet with a password or passcode to protect your information even if the devices are lost or stolen. Require use of the password or passcode when starting the device or after short periods of inactivity.</li>
          <li>Choose passwords that are easy for you to remember but difficult for others to guess. Avoid using personal information in passwords like familiar phone numbers and birthdays. In general, a longer password is more secure than a shorter password.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Other security tips</h4>
        <p>
          Many smart phones and tablets now include the ability to ‘self-destruct'
          after some number of unauthorized access attempts. Others can be erased
          remotely. Learn about the security features unique to your device and decide
          if they're right for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some computers and other devices now use biometric devices like
          fingerprint scanners to keep information secure. Learn about the security
          features unique to your computer and decide if they're right for you.
        </p>
        <h4>Information that can't be protected</h4>
        <p>As hard as we try, there is some information that we simply do not control. Consider these tips when sharing personal health information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Never post anything online that you don't want made public. Even private
            online resources like moderated forums may expose your information to the
            broader public Internet.
          </li>
          <li>
            Never assume that others won't share the information you share with
            them. If you send personal health information in an email, even to a trusted
            person, the possibility exists that they will forward it to someone else, or that
            someone unauthorized will access their email.
          </li>
          <li>
            Never assume that others take your privacy as seriously as you do. Once
            you give a record to someone else, whether a physical folder of papers or an
            email with a test result, that information is out of your hands. Others may not
            take the steps to protect your information that you would take yourself.
          </li>
        </ul>
