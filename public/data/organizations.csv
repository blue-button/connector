Our office believes that family medicine is a specialty dedicated to providing continuing and comprehensive health care with the patient in the center participating in their decision making. Our physician combines unique abilities including attitude, communications and technical skills, health maintenance,health promotion,counseling,education, preventative care and rehabilitation services. Dr Fox has utilized computer services for years having a full EMR, RX prescribing, and an active  patient portal.  This encourages patients to make their own appointments, review their test results ,email messages  and encouragement of decision making. Through these beliefs our office has participated in meaningful use since it's inception in 2011. We are actively working on MU2 second stage. Believing in quality care measurements and patient safety technical support is now essential for both the patient's, physician  and staff. Supporting the role that patient's should actively contribute to their health care decisions this office then structured to partnership with our physician, staff, patients,families and community to ensure that decisions are made respecting the patients' wants, needs, preferences, socioeconomic background and education.  With theses goals in mind we then actively engaged in the NCQA Patient Centered Medical Home process and achieved level 3 thoroughly incorporating all aspects into our daily care. Our efforts are to continually look at how we practice and to always strive to improve quality comprehensive care with emphasis on our patient 's health ,technical support, efficiency, cost effectiveness,  and ongoing medical expertise.",true,"Craig D.
