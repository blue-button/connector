              <div class="panel-body">The Blue Button Connector is a website that helps people get started finding out about Blue Button and where they might be able to get their own health information online. This web site is about transparency&mdash;as it continues to get populated it aims to let people know what is and is not available today. The site also helps people find applications (apps) and tools that are available to manage and make use of their electronic health data. The Blue Button Connector is not a repository or government database that houses patients' health information or pulls that information from various sources into a single place.</p><p>The Blue Button Connector also helps developers find out what type of electronic health data is being shared with people so they can build applications (apps) and tools that utilize that health data to help consumers better understand and use their health information. It’s a tool for use by multiple parties that creates transparency about the increasing availability of structured health data and where organizations are along the continuum of adopting and implementing ways that patients can access and use their health data online.</p></div>

            <div id="faq1" class="panel-collapse collapse">
              <div class="panel-body"><p>The Blue Button Connector was born out of a need for consumers to have a single place to get started finding and accessing their personal health information online. Although the number of organizations providing people with online access to their health information (Blue Button) is growing (and is expected to increase significantly via implementation by eligible providers and hospitals of the Meaningful Use Stage 2 requirements that patients be able to view, download and transmit their health records electronically), many consumers still do not know how or where to access their health data from any source.</p></div>

              <div class="panel-body"><p>The Blue Button Connector has great appeal for entrepreneurs and developers because of the transparency it provides about what type of data is being made available and how it’s being made available (in what format, using what transport mechanism). This information is available to developers through an <a href="http://api.bluebuttonconnector.healthit.gov/">open API</a>. The Connector also provides a place where consumers and others can find the tools developers have built that use structured health data.</p></div>

              <div class="panel-body"><p>The Blue Button Connector only recently launched in 2014. There remains an ongoing effort to add new organizations to the site and to have organizations create and manage their own profiles. If you can’t find your provider on the Blue Button Connector, they may still offer online access. Check with your provider’s office and ask them if they offer online access to health records, and how you can start using this feature.</p></div>

              <div class="panel-body"><p>Yes. The Connector is the first ever open data source delivered through an <a href="http://api.bluebuttonconnector.healthit.gov/">open API</a> that makes transparent the health data that is increasingly available to the public. By having an open API, we hope to fuel the creation of new products and services. This is part of a broader push for open data spearheaded by the White House to liberate both government data and voluntarily contributed corporate data to fuel entrepreneurship, create jobs, and improve the lives of Americans in tangible ways.</p></div>

Organizations must be providing one or more of the following features: displaying the Blue Button logo, providing ability to view records, ability to download records, ability to securely send records to preferred application, ability to receive automatic updates among other individual features. As it relates to applications and other tools, organizations featured there must be able to ingest structured health data.
